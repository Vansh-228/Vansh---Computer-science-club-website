  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>My name is Vansh and I am a high school grade 9 student at White Oaks. I am in the computer science club and this is my first time making a html website. I like to play sports during my free time and read books. Some sports I like to play are soccer, basketball, tennis and many more. Some of my favorite books are Ground zero, Scythe and They Both Die in the End.</p>
